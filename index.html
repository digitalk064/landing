<h3>
About Slizer</h3>
Slizer was developed by me, Khanh Le (full name: Lê Vũ Nguyên Khanh), in 2017 as an experimental project. It was my first step into game development 
and my first ever self-published app. I've learned a lot from working on this game, including coding, collaboration, designing, publishing and even some legal stuff.
I've implemented ads and analytics mostly as experiments and gaining more knowledge, though they've since been removed to make the game fully enjoyable.
There will be no more updates for Slizer but I hope everyone who tried my game out got at least some fun out of it. I, along with my friends, 
have really enjoyed crafting this together.  <br />
